# Deploy microservices on Kubernetes
This repo contains the source code for my tutorial on [deploying microservices on Kubernetes](http://alphacoder.xyz/deploy-microservices-on-kubernetes). It houses two microservices: _detector_ and _viewer_. The detector service is a Python/Flask app that uses a pre-trained [YOLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgxsv1riJhI) v3 model to detect [common objects](detector/classes.txt) like laptops and chairs in an image. It returns a link to an output image of object predictions and a list of the detected objects. The viewer service is a PHP app which provides a front-end for uploading new images and viewing the images processed by the detector service.
